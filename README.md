## GLSkeleton: A Geometric Laplacian-based Skeletonisation Framework for Object Point Clouds
### Abstract 
The curve skeleton is known to geometric mod-
elling and computer graphics communities as one of the shape
descriptors which intuitively indicates the topological properties
of the objects. In recent years, studies have also suggested the
potential of applying curve skeletons to assist robotic reasoning
and planning. However, the raw scanned point cloud model is
typically incomplete and noisy. Besides, dealing with a large
point cloud is also computationally inefficient. Focusing on
curve skeletonisation of incomplete and poorly-distributed point
clouds of objects, an efficient geometric Laplacian-based skele-
tonisation framework (GLSkeleton) is proposed in this work.
We also present the computational efficiency of the introduced
local reduction strategy (LPR) approach without sacrificing
the main topological structure. Comprehensive experiments
have been conducted to benchmark performance using an
open source dataset, and they have demonstrated a significant
improvement in both contraction and overall skeletonisation
computational speed.
